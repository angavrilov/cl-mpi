===================================================
1. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

The long-term goal of CL-MPI is to provide a portable Common Lisp
binding for MPI. I hope that eventually, any Common Lisp
implementation which supports CFFI can be used with any MPI implementation.
In the meantime, here are the currently tested configurations:

Tested MPI implementations:
   - MPICH 1.2.5.3-2  (on Ubuntu Linux 8.04)

Tested Lisp implementations.
   - Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) 1.0.22,1.0.24
   - CMU Common Lisp 19e


Tested configurations:
1) MPICH 1.2.5.3-2 on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 with SBCL 1.0.22
2) MPICH 1.2.5.3-2 on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 with CMUCL 19e


===================================================
2. DEPENDENCIES

   ASDF

   CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface), version 0.10.3 or later
        Tested with 0.10.3

===================================================
3. INSTALLATION

a) Install all of the systems which CL-MPI depends on:
  1) Install a supported MPI implementation (currently only MPICH)
  2) Install the CFFI library, version 0.10.3 or later.  

------------------------------------------

b) Configure the installation.
Open cl-mpi-configure.lisp in an editor.

  1) Specify location of MPI header file
     Modify the following line so that it points to the correct location for the mpi.h header file
     (defvar *mpi-header-file* "/usr/include/mpi/mpi.h")

  2) Specify MPI shared library location
     The second form in cl-mpi-configure.lisp configures how the MPI shared library is loaded.
     For example, the current default is:          
     (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
        (defun load-mpi-foreign-libraries ()
           (cffi:use-foreign-library "/usr/lib/mpich-shmem/lib/shared/libmpich-shmem.so") ; this should work for a standard MPICH implementation
        )
        (load-mpi-foreign-libraries))
        (format t "Loaded MPI libraries!~%"))

     Modify the string after cffi:use-foreign-library to point to the MPI shared library (.so file) to load.


------------------------------------------
c) Build CL-MPI

Start Lisp in the directory where the CL-MPI sources reside, and build the CL-MPI system:

CL-USER> (asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-op 'cl-mpi)

===================================================
4. TESTING

After installation is complete, we can try running the CL-MPI test
program, which runs many tests to verify that the library works
correctly.


Do NOT use SLIME or the Lisp implementation's native
REPL to start the test program.  As with all MPI programs, you must
start the MPI environment (e.g., using the standard "mpirun" command)
and execute the Lisp program within MPI.

The exact command to run will depend on your Lisp implementation and
MPI implementation.

  EXAMPLE Commands for running the CL-MPI test suite:

  For SBCL and MPICH:

  Go to the directory where the CL-MPI sources are located, and 
  at the shell prompt, enter:

    mpirun -np 2 /usr/local/bin/sbcl --load "run-mpi-test.lisp"


  The above command starts MPI (with the mpirun executable), using 2
  processes.  Each process starts SBCL (which, in this example, is
  located at /usr/local/bin/sbcl), and SBCL is instructed to load (and
  execute) the test suite (run-mpi-test.lisp).
  You may or may not have to enter the full path to SBCL, depending on
  your environment.

  Similarly, for CMUCL and MPICH, run the command:
     mpirun -np 2 /usr/local/bin/lisp -load "run-mpi-test.lisp"


-------------------
Alternate, Quick build and test instruction
the included Makefile should work if you are using a
standard installation of SBCL and MPICH
try:
 make test
This will build and test CL-MPI

------------------



===================================================
5. NOTES:

** Unfortunately, CL-MPI can not be installed using
ASDF-INSTALL because CL-MPI must be provided the location of the mpi.h
header file, as well as the location of the MPI shared library.
However, I might be wrong, and any patches to make installation easier
are welcome!
