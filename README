===================================================
1. SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

The long-term goal of CL-MPI is to provide a portable Common Lisp
binding for MPI. I hope that eventually, any Common Lisp
implementation which supports CFFI can be used with any MPI implementation.
In the meantime, here are the currently tested configurations:

Tested MPI implementations:
   - MPICH 1.2.5.3-2  (on Ubuntu Linux 8.04)
   - MPICH2-1.0.8p1   (on Ubuntu Linux 8.04)

Tested Lisp implementations.
   - Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) 1.0.22,1.0.24,1.0.28
   - CMU Common Lisp 19e

Successfully tested configurations:
1) MPICH 1.2.5.3-2 on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 with SBCL 1.0.28
2) MPICH 1.2.5.3-2 on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 with CMUCL 19e
3) MPICH2-1.0.8p1 on Ubuntu Linux 8.04 with SBCL 1.0.28

I have also tried OpenMPI 1.3.2 (Ubuntu Linux 8.04) + SBCL 1.0.28.
While CL-MPI appears to build normally, any call to an MPI function results in a crash.
This may or may not be be related to:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openmpi/+bug/210273
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-numpy/+bug/307901
Since my own projects are currently based on MPICH 1.2 and MPICH2, I
haven't put too much effort into OpenMPI. 
Please let me know if you get CL-MPI working with OpenMPI!




===================================================
2. DEPENDENCIES

   ASDF

   CFFI (C Foreign Function Interface), version 0.10.3 or later
        Tested with CFFI 0.10.4

===================================================
3. INSTALLATION


-------------------
QUICKSTART 
The included Makefile should work if you are using a
standard installation of SBCL and MPICH,
or a standard installatin of CMUCL and MPICH
try: 
   [for SBCL]
   make asdf-links    <-- creates links to this directory from the standard local
   make test-sbcl

   [for CMU]
    make test-cmu

If the above make command doesn't result in the CL-MPI test suite
being executed, then some installation steps may be necessary, so
continue reading!

------------------


a) Install all of the systems which CL-MPI depends on:
  1) Install a supported MPI implementation (currently only MPICH)
  2) Install the CFFI library, version 0.10.3 or later.  

------------------------------------------

b) Configure the installation.

  0) Open cl-mpi-configure.lisp in an editor.

  1) Specify location of MPI header file
     Modify the following line so that it points to the correct location for the mpi.h header file
     (defvar *mpi-header-file* "/usr/include/mpi/mpi.h")

  2) Specify MPI shared library location
     The second form in cl-mpi-configure.lisp configures how the MPI shared library is loaded.
     For example, the current default is:          
     (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
        (defun load-mpi-foreign-libraries ()
           (cffi:use-foreign-library "/usr/lib/mpich-shmem/lib/shared/libmpich-shmem.so") ; this should work for a standard MPICH implementation
        )
        (load-mpi-foreign-libraries))
        (format t "Loaded MPI libraries!~%"))

     Modify the string after cffi:use-foreign-library to point to the MPI shared library (.so file) to load.


  3) If you are using MPICH2, uncomment the line:
     Otherwise, leave this line commented





------------------------------------------
c) Build CL-MPI

Start Lisp in the directory where the CL-MPI sources reside, and build the CL-MPI system:

CL-USER> (asdf:operate 'asdf:compile-op 'cl-mpi)

===================================================
4. TESTING

After installation is complete, we can try running the CL-MPI test
program, which runs many tests to verify that the library works
correctly.


Do NOT use SLIME or the Lisp implementation's native
REPL to start the test program.  As with all MPI programs, you must
start the MPI environment (e.g., using the standard "mpirun" command)
and execute the Lisp program within MPI.

The exact command to run will depend on your Lisp implementation and
MPI implementation.

  EXAMPLE Commands for running the CL-MPI test suite:

  For SBCL and MPICH:

  Go to the directory where the CL-MPI sources are located, and 
  at the shell prompt, enter:

    mpirun -np 2 /usr/local/bin/sbcl --load "run-mpi-test.lisp"


  The above command starts MPI (with the mpirun executable), using 2
  processes.  Each process starts SBCL (which, in this example, is
  located at /usr/local/bin/sbcl), and SBCL is instructed to load (and
  execute) the test suite (run-mpi-test.lisp).
  You may or may not have to enter the full path to SBCL, depending on
  your environment.

  Similarly, for CMUCL and MPICH, run the command:
     mpirun -np 2 /usr/local/bin/lisp -load "run-mpi-test.lisp"





===================================================
5. NOTES:

** Unfortunately, CL-MPI can not be installed using ASDF-INSTALL
because CL-MPI must be provided the location of the mpi.h header file,
as well as the location of the MPI shared library, and I haven't
figured out how to do this so that it works at least most of the time.
Any patches to make installation easier are welcome!
